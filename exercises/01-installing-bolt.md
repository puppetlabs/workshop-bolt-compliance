# Exercise #1: Installing Bolt

## Steps

1. Go to [the Bolt installation documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_installing.html)

- Follow the instructions to install Bolt for your OS platform.
 For example, if running Windows follow the instructions for installing Bolt with MSI.
 
 If running Windows and you have a command shell open when you install Bolt, ensure you close and reopen the command shell so that the environmental variables are    picked up



2. Open a command shell and run `bolt --version`

Sample output:

```
PS C:\code\boltshop> bolt --version
2.27.0
```

You need **at least** version 2.22.0 installed. If you on an earlier release, visit [the Bolt documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_installing.html).
