## Overview
This module sets and enforces the local security policies for windows.

## Module Description
This module uses secedit.exe to configure the local security policies on Windows. 
Secedit can configure and analyze system security by comparing the current configuration to specified security templates.

## Local_security_policy features
Configure local security policy (LSP) for windows servers.
LSP is key to a baseline configuration of the following security features:

### Account Policy
  * Password Policy
  * Account Lockout Policy

### Local Policy
  * Audit Policy
  * User Rights Assignment
  * Security Options
  * Registry Values

This module uses types and providers to list, update, validate settings

## Usage
The title and name of the resources is an exact match of what is in `secpol.msc` GUI. If you are uncertain of the setting name and values just use `puppet resource local_security_policy` to list all configured settings.

A block will look like this:
```
local_security_policy { 'Audit account logon events': <- Title / Name
  ensure         => present,              <- Usually set to present. Can be set to absent for some policy settings.
  policy_setting => "AuditAccountLogon",  <- The secedit file key. Informational purposes only, not for use in manifest definitions
  policy_type    => "Event Audit",        <- The secedit file section, Informational purposes only, not for use in manifest definitions
  policy_value   => 'Success,Failure',    <- Values
}
```

### Setting or merging User Rights
With `Privilege Rights` it is possible to `set:` the value or to `merge:` the values.
When using the `set:` option, the `policy_value` is set as the desired value. Do not use '+' or '-' when using `set:`.
When using the `merge:` option, the `policy_value` is merged with the existing value. '+' will add a value and '-' will remove a value.
If you do not use `set:` or `merge:` then `set:` will be the default.

### Listing all local security policies
Show all local_security_policy resources available on server
```
puppet resource local_security_policy
```
Show a single local_security_policy resources available on server
```
puppet resource local_security_policy 'Maximum password age'
```

### Examples
#### Example Password Policy
```
local_security_policy { 'Maximum password age':
  ensure       => 'present',
  policy_value => '90',
}
```
Sets the policy_value of 'Maximum password age' to '90'.

#### Example Audit Policy
```
local_security_policy { 'Audit account logon events':
  ensure       => 'present',
  policy_value => 'Success,Failure',
}
```

#### Example User Rights Policy
```
local_security_policy { 'Allow log on locally':
  ensure       => present,
  policy_value => 'Administrators, MyDomain\Domain Admins',
}
```

Administrators and Remote Desktop Users will be set:
```
local_security_policy { 'Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services':
  ensure       => 'present',
  policy_value => 'set: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users',
}
```

Administrators and Remote Desktop Users will be added and Power Users will be removed:
```
local_security_policy { 'Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services':
  ensure       => 'present',
  policy_value => 'merge: Administrators, +Remote Desktop Users, -Power Users',
}
```

#### Example Security Settings

```
local_security_policy { 'System cryptography: Use FIPS compiant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing':
  ensure       => 'present',
  policy_value => 'enabled',
}
```

When you can select an option, specify the exact option as displayed in the `secpol.msc` GUI.
```
local_security_policy { 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode':
  ensure       => 'present',
  policy_value => 'Elevate without prompting',
}
```

## How this works
The local_security_policy works by using `secedit /export` to export a list of currently set policies.  The module will then
take the user defined resource and compare the values against the exported policies.  If the values on the system do not match
the defined resource, the module will run `secedit /configure` to configure the policy on the system.  If the policy already
exists on the system no change will be made.

In order to make setting these polices easier, this module has extracted some of the difficult to lookup or remember pieces
of a policy and placed them in a map for easy translation and value conversion.  This means that you only need to remember the user
instead of the sid value, as well as the policy description instead of the special key that needs to be set.  The mappings
below define how this translation works.  If there is no map for your policy you will need to add to `lib/puppet_x/lsp/security_policy.rb`

```
'Accounts: Rename administrator account' => {
  :name        => 'NewAdministratorName',
  :policy_type => 'System Access',
  :data_type   => :quoted_string
},
'Recovery console: Allow floppy copy and access to all drives and all folders' => {
  :name        => 'MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Setup\RecoveryConsole\SetCommand',
  :reg_type    => '4',
  :policy_type => 'Registry Values',
},
```

The key `Accounts: Rename administrator account ` in the first hash is what the user will define as the name in the resource name.
Instead of remembering the policy name, the description will help us remember what the policy is for.  When defining new policy
maps you will need to define the key, name, policy_type, and optionally, data_type or reg_type.

Currently for data_type there is `:string`, `:integer`, `:boolean` or `:multi_select`.  For reg_type (integer value) there are many values which are listed below:

```
    REG_NONE 0
    REG_SZ 1
    REG_EXPAND_SZ 2
    REG_BINARY 3
    REG_DWORD 4
    REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN 4
    REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN 5
    REG_LINK 6
    REG_MULTI_SZ 7
    REG_RESOURCE_LIST 8
    REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR 9
    REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST 10
    REG_QWORD 11
    REG_QWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN 11
```
